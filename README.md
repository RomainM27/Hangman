  <summary> The mission :</summary>
  

  You have to make a website version of the [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) word game. To do so
  try to think the *structure*, the "*backend*" (functionality) and the *frontend*
  (design) of your project before you start coding.

  **At the very least your version of the *hangman* should:**

  - propose an hidden word
  - allow the selection of letters
  - verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
  - count the number of failure (lives)
  - check if it's a *game over*
  - check if the word as been found

  **Optionally it can**:

  - keep in memory all guessed letters
  - only let the player guess a letter once
  - add an image for each step
  - check keyboard recognition

  **Bonus**:

  - use canvas

  NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing
  things, what matters is the end result.

  **Instructions**:

  * create the repository
  * think the project through
  * make it functional
  * write the frontend (make it pretty)
  * implement both parts into a web page
